Hey all, this is an intro to the docs folder where I can expand on what I'm actually doing and why in this project.

Find a description of the projects architecture in the aptly named /architecture
Find the physics & simulation theory used to develop this app in /physics
Find guides on how to use and develop existing and new tools to create your own sims in /usage
